##
I'm an undergraduate studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a Bachelor in Information Science and Data Science.

I have a passion for human-centered design. Blending my interests in Data Science and UX Design, I strive to create projects that positively influence communities around me. My primary passion is user experience research and design, interacting with clients on their requirements and experiences and using that knowledge to design prototypes for applications that solve these issues.


### As an Employee,
![picture](../JDTeam.jpg)
I work as a Cybersecurity Software Engineer in a global security platform team at John Deere ISG as a part time student. I joined this team in May of 2023.

In the global security platform team, I primarily work on full stack projects. Working with experienced developers and cybersecurity professionals and engineering managers is a very insightful experience. It has allowed me the opportunity to apply my skills and work hands on with employees on products. This immersive experience into the team and the product lifecycle gives me foundational knowledge of tools and technologies during my work in my Computer Science and Data Science courses at Illinois.

I headed a project that involved using a Github API to track milestones and analytics regarding our teams productivity metrics. I was responsible for creating a full stack application that pulled data from our Kanban Board which we used to visualize our issue cards, gather metrics regarding time for completion of cards based on different factors (size, milestones, product), and creating visualizations using OpenSearch software. We decided to integrate the product into an existing product that already analyzes and creates visualizations of the data for us.

### As a Student,
I am a Data Science + Information Science Major at the University of Illinois. With a focus in Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience, my interdisciplinary speciallization allows me to take courses in numerous departments in the university. Computer Science, Art, Business, Engineering, and Psychology are a few departments I take courses in.

During my freshman year, I was involved in undergraduate human computer interaction research where I conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of educational games and technologies in enhancing learning
outcomes.

I was also involved in a student organization *Design for America* where I worked with a team of 4 to design a portable learning station for a library along with a client.
